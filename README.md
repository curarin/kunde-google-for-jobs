# Google for Jobs Tool
 Streamlit App for increasing google for jobs performance for a very specific use case which needs individual crawling pings and title / h1 tag generation.

 ## Starting point
 We currently do have some issues providing automatic internal linking to job detail pages, which results in a lack of crawling more often than not. Providing the Ping Tool to the client improved crawling (and sometimes also indexing) rate, which further increases chances to be shown in Google for Jobs vertical.

 In order to optimize Title Tag for google for Jobs performance we also used a custom trained GPT3.5-model for high quality and low price title tag generation for the client.
